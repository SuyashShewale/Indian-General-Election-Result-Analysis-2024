# India General Elections Result Analysis 2024 (SQL Project)

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes the **2024 Indian General Election results** using **SQL**. It explores seat distribution, alliance performance, candidate details, and voting patterns across constituencies and states. The analysis provides insights into the performance of major political alliances such as **NDA**, **I.N.D.I.A.**, and **OTHER** parties.  

The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can be leveraged to handle large election datasets, extract KPIs, and generate meaningful insights for political analysis.
